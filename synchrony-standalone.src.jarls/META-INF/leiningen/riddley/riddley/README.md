    Walker is my name
    and I am the same.
    Riddley Walker.
    Walking my riddels
    where ever theyve took me
    and walking them now
    on this paper the same.

Code may be data, but only some of that data is executable.  If we want to perform a pervasive code transformation, using something like `clojure.walk` presents a few problems:

* binding forms are treated the same as actual expressions
* `clojure.walk/macroexpand-all` will pass in a nil `&env` to all macros
* macroexpansion doesn't expand inlined functions

This means that transforms that we intend to apply to expressions may have unintended consequences on a `fn`, `let`, or `case` form.  It also means that any macro which relies on `&env` will not compose with our transformation.  Finally, if inlined functions aren't expanded, this can break certain transformations.

### usage

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ztellman/riddley.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ztellman/riddley)

```clj
[riddley "0.1.12"]
```

Riddley provides a correct `riddley.walk/macroexpand-all`, which preserves the binding information in `&env` and expands inlined functions, and `riddley.walk/walk-exprs`, which is a general mechanism for code walking and transformation.

`walk-exprs` takes two arguments, a `predicate` for whether it should transform the sub-form, and a `handler` for doing the transformation.

```clj
riddley.walk> (walk-exprs number? inc '(let [n 1] (+ n 1)))
(let* [n 2] (. clojure.lang.Numbers (add n 2)))
```

Notice that `walk-exprs` implicitly macroexpands the form, including the inline form for `+`.  Unlike `clojure.walk`, if `handler` is called, sub-forms will not be walked.  The handler function is responsible for recursively calling `walk-exprs` on the form it's handed.

Access to `&env` is available via `(riddley.compiler/locals)` if you need it as part of your transformation.
