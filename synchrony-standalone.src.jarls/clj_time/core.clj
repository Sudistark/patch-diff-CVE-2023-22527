(ns clj-time.core
  "The core namespace for date-time operations in the clj-time library.

   Create a DateTime instance with date-time (or a LocalDateTime instance with local-date-time),
   specifying the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond:

     => (date-time 1986 10 14 4 3 27 456)
     #<DateTime 1986-10-14T04:03:27.456Z>

     => (local-date-time 1986 10 14 4 3 27 456)
     #<LocalDateTime 1986-10-14T04:03:27.456>

   Less-significant fields can be omitted:

     => (date-time 1986 10 14)
     #<DateTime 1986-10-14T00:00:00.000Z>

     => (local-date-time 1986 10 14)
     #<LocalDateTime 1986-10-14T00:00:00.000>

   Get the current time with (now) and the start of the Unix epoch with (epoch).

   Once you have a date-time, use accessors like hour and second to access the
   corresponding fields:

     => (hour (date-time 1986 10 14 22))
     22

     => (hour (local-date-time 1986 10 14 22))
     22

   The date-time constructor always returns times in the UTC time zone. If you
   want a time with the specified fields in a different time zone, use
   from-time-zone:

     => (from-time-zone (date-time 1986 10 22) (time-zone-for-offset -2))
     #<DateTime 1986-10-22T00:00:00.000-02:00>

   If on the other hand you want a given absolute instant in time in a
   different time zone, use to-time-zone:

     => (to-time-zone (date-time 1986 10 22) (time-zone-for-offset -2))
     #<DateTime 1986-10-21T22:00:00.000-02:00>

   In addition to time-zone-for-offset, you can use the time-zone-for-id and
   default-time-zone functions and the utc Var to construct or get DateTimeZone
   instances.

   The functions after? and before? determine the relative position of two
   DateTime instances:

     => (after? (date-time 1986 10) (date-time 1986 9))
     true

     => (after? (local-date-time 1986 10) (local-date-time 1986 9))
     true

   Often you will want to find a date some amount of time from a given date. For
   example, to find the time 1 month and 3 weeks from a given date-time:

     => (plus (date-time 1986 10 14) (months 1) (weeks 3))
     #<DateTime 1986-12-05T00:00:00.000Z>

     => (plus (local-date-time 1986 10 14) (months 1) (weeks 3))
     #<LocalDateTime 1986-12-05T00:00:00.000Z>

   An Interval is used to represent the span of time between two DateTime
   instances. Construct one using interval, then query them using within?,
   overlaps?, and abuts?

     => (within? (interval (date-time 1986) (date-time 1990))
                 (date-time 1987))
     true

   To find the amount of time encompassed by an interval, use in-seconds and
   in-minutes:

     => (in-minutes (interval (date-time 1986 10 2) (date-time 1986 10 14)))
     17280

   The overlap function can be used to get an Interval representing the
   overlap between two intervals:

     => (overlap (t/interval (t/date-time 1986) (t/date-time 1990))
                             (t/interval (t/date-time 1987) (t/date-time 1991)))
     #<Interval 1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z/1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z>

   Note that all functions in this namespace work with Joda objects or ints. If
   you need to print or parse date-times, see clj-time.format. If you need to
   coerce date-times to or from other types, see clj-time.coerce."
